\chapter{Prerequisites}
Before we can move on to the main results, we need to set up a few defitions even though they are quite common because they slightly vary over different publications. In this chapter we review the terms from graph theory and optimization which appear to become most important and frequently used in the main chapters.

\section{Graphs}
As long as not stated otherwise a graph is undirectedand has neither loops mor parallel edges.

\begin{definition} [\(k\)-connected]\label{def:k_connected}\ \\
  A graph G is \(k\)-connected if it remains connected after removel of any \(k-1\) nodes and all their adjacent edges.
\end{definition}

So the terms \(1\)-connected and connected coincides while the word \glqq{} biconnected \grqq{} is an alias to \(2\)-connected.
